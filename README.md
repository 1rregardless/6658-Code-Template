*6658 Code Template*
--------------------

This project is a simple template for our FRC robot code. It includes a custom telnet subsystem for modifying the behavior of robot code at runtime

The telnet interface is based on the kTelnet library. It allows for an interactive shell exposed on port 5999 which can modify values inside of the robot program,
such as autonomous mode switching an constant tuning.

*TODO*
-------------------
Add autonomous value subsystem
Add documentation folder
